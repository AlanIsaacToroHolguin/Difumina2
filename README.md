## 📌 Project Overview  

**DIFUMINA2** is my main project at **SENA**, developed to establish an online presence for my **rock band**. Following proper software development practices, I began with:  

- 📝 Comprehensive documentation  
- 📊 UML diagrams  
- 🗃️ Database design  
- ⚙️ Technology stack selection  

Only after this planning phase did I proceed to implementation.  

## 🛠️ Technology Stack  

| Component       | Technology          |
|----------------|---------------------|
| **Frontend**   | Angular 19 (TypeScript, SCSS) |
| **Backend**    | Node.js (Express.js) |
| **Database**   | MongoDB             |
| **Styling**    | SCSS + Responsive   |
| **Build Tool** | Angular CLI         |

Key formatting improvements:
1. Proper Markdown headers with `#`, `##`, `###`
2. Correct code blocks with triple backticks (```)
3. Consistent use of `**bold**` for emphasis
4. Clean tables for structured data
5. Proper list formatting with `-` and `1.`
