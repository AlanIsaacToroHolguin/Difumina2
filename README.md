# Difumina2
One of my main projects at SENA is DIFUMINA2, aimed at giving my rock band an online presence. I first focused on documentation, diagrams, database planning, and defining the tech stack, as a software analyst must plan from scratch, not just code. Now, with that foundation set, Iâ€™ve created the repository to organize and update development.
